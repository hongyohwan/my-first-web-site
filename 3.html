    <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that has become an <strong>essential tool in modern web development</strong>. Originally created to add interactivity to web pages, JavaScript has evolved into a <strong>full-fledged programming language capable of running on both client-side and server-side environments</strong>. It allows developers to create <strong>dynamic, interactive web applications</strong> that respond to user actions in real-time. With its easy-to-learn syntax and wide range of libraries and frameworks, JavaScript has become the <strong>go-to language for front-end development</strong>, enabling features like form validation, animations, and asynchronous data loading. Moreover, with the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has extended its reach to <strong>server-side programming, database management, and even desktop application development</strong>, making it a truly universal language in the world of software development.
