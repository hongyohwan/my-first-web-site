    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web, commonly known as the Web, is a <strong>vast interconnected system of information</strong> accessible through the Internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and has since revolutionized how we communicate, work, and access information. The Web consists of billions of web pages, documents, and other resources, all linked together through hyperlinks and URLs. These resources are hosted on web servers around the world and can be accessed using web browsers. The Web operates on a client-server model, where users' devices (clients) request information from servers, which then deliver the requested content. Over the years, the Web has evolved from simple static pages to <strong>dynamic, interactive platforms</strong> that support complex applications, e-commerce, social media, and more. It has become an integral part of modern society, <strong>transforming nearly every aspect of our daily lives</strong>, from education and business to entertainment and social interactions.
