    <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
        CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology in web development that brings life and style to the otherwise plain HTML structure of websites. It's the language that controls the visual presentation of web pages, allowing developers to define colors, layouts, fonts, and animations. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them, creating a separation between content and design. This separation not only makes websites more visually appealing but also improves maintainability and allows for responsive design across different devices. Since its introduction in 1996, CSS has evolved significantly, with newer versions introducing powerful features like flexbox and grid layouts, transforming the way we design for the web.
